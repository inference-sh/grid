# grid — open source ai app store for inference.sh

150+ ai models and apps: image generation (flux, stable diffusion), video generation (veo, seedance), llms (claude, gpt, gemini), and more.

*a digital frontier.*

i tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer. what did they look like? ships? motorcycles? were the circuits like freeways? i kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see—
and then, one day, i got in.
